# CS-255_System-Analysis_Design
  For this course, I had to design a system for the client DriverPass. The client requested a system for their application to run on. This system required that the user be able to create  
an online account, study for driving tests using online resources, request to practice driving with instructors, and contact support if needed. They also requested that there be admin 
privileges that would allow them to help with user issues, as well as access and download reports. Lastly, we had to convey that the system would stay up-to-date with current documentation
relating to driving courses, as well as scheduling times. 

  I think I did a great job of breaking down the users requirements from the interview transcript provided. I know I missed a few things as well, but alltogether the system was designed
successfully and looked great. If I could revise one thing, it would be the case diagram. When I developed it, I missed a few actors and use cses that were required by the system. I would like to have had another chance to revise it and add those actors and use cses for a better looking use case diagram. 

  User requirements are the foundation to any design process. Without them, there would be no map of what we are developing. Having a clearer picture of what you are designing produces a 
more accurate product that the client has requested. If not, you are just adding more work in revisions later on which adds debt to the project. Understanding and interpreting the clients
needs successfully show that you are taking the development process seriously, and will produce a better product in the end. 

  Before I started school, I was a self-taught developer. I thought I knew it all, and that was reflected in the projects I worked on. I hardly ever spent time designing an idea, rather 
just jump right into coding it. After learning the proper processses and development lifecycles, I spend the majority of time designing now. I have learned that the more time spent 
developing, the easier it will be when programming or creating the product. I specifically like using UML diagrams, and how they can really bring a product from an idea, to something 
tangible. Also, taking that initial time to understand and interpret the users requirements really can change the direction of a product and how quickly it is completed.
